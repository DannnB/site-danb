# EE Expert - Internal Portal
### Project Source: Design Agency

The project was to create an employee portal for gamification of learning. It used mini games, points and leaderboards taking data from various regions, stores and employees. A forum was needed for any user to have discussions with their colleagues about learning subjects.

I was involved in interpreting the designs and creating modular frontend components that can be reused. Accessibility was needed so I focused on semantics for each component to make it accessible. One of the mini games I designed and developed was a timed questions quiz.This is where the user had to answer in the best time possible to gain more points. It worked on desktop and mobile.

It was a great success, leading to more informed employees. Allowing them to earn incentives and prizes.
