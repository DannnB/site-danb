### Project Source: Design Agency

A portal was needed to share B2B information among employees to help connect data.

In this portal I helped create the frontend alongside other developers. A strong use of colour to differentiate between document sections was used and was very useful when developing.

Resulting in an easy to use and informative web portal for all users.
