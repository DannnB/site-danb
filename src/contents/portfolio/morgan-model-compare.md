# Morgan - Model Compare
### Project Source: In-house

The company needed a way for users to compare models easily and quickly. This resulted in the creation of a VueJS app on the main site.

For this I created and designed a functional and simple interactive experience. Taking data from APIs and factory systems for regional pricing and specs. Working on mobile, tablets and desktop it changes models per region, pricing and specs where relevant.
