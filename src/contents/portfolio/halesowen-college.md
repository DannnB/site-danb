# Halesowen College
### Project Source: Design Agency

They wanted a more engaging and modern site ready for new and current students. This included a course search which worked very well, showing the large selection they have to offer. Keeping any SEO stats was a key point too and this was worked on by myself using various third-party services like SEMRush.

For this site I worked alongside the designers and backend developers where I created most of the frontend and various bits of interactive JavaScript. Also,I took the SEO and Accessibility opportunities to further advance my skills in making an effective front-facing education site.

This resulted in an increase of traffic and user flow throughout the process. Increases in submitted applications. Delivered on time and supported after go-live including SEO / UX changes.
