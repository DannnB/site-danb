# Airmax Remote
### Project Source: Design Agency

A new landing page was needed for a telematics company to showcase their product. This involved multiple sections of varying information so icons and images were used to aid each section. This included design of a backend portal.

Following the designs of a web designer I created an accurate version of the frontend. This included testing using Browserstack and other tools to examine the responsiveness. SEO was made priority as this was a new site and needed to make a successful start on search engines. I used SEMRush to keep track of position, competitors and to take advantage of new avenues of traffic or advertising.

A strong Google valued page was a result with lots of acquisitions from new traffic.
